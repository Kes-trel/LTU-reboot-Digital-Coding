    <!-- FIXED START
        function called "FixStart"
        function has a single variable assigned to it
        function checks first letter
        if the first letter repeats itself later in the variable - word
        then it replaces the the consecutive letter with a "*"
        but not the first letter itself

        FUNCTION ("Fixed Start")
        VAR = WORD
        FOR LOOP:
        set a counter to first letter of the string [0]
        condition - break when counter is equal to length of the string
        increment counter by 1 letter [1++] (not quite sure the code for this yet)

        IF letter is equal to "first letter" then
            print "*" instead
        ELSE just print a letter (i assume it will print in seperate lines - need to try)

        RETURN result

        Print results
